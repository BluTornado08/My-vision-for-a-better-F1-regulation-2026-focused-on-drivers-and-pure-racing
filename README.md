## 🎯 What is this?

This is a full **alternative technical and sporting regulation** for Formula 1 starting from 2026.  
It’s written to re-focus F1 on **driver skill**, **mechanical grip**, and **pure, unforgiving racing** — removing unnecessary complexity and electronic control systems.

📄 Includes a full PDF written in **FIA-style article format**.

## 🔧 Core Concepts

- **Naturally aspirated V10/V8 engines** – no hybrid, no MGU-K/H
- **Active suspension only in straights**, FIA-controlled (anti-porpoising)
- **Mechanical differential only** – no electronic control
- **Front-biased aero** → oversteer, skill-based driving
- **Simplified rear wing**, free front wing & floor
- **No DRS, no energy recovery, no dynamic balance systems**

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

> The car should challenge the driver.  
> More oversteer, more mistakes, more real racing.

The idea is to reward car control, reduce aero wake, and allow real fights without needing artificial overtaking tools.
